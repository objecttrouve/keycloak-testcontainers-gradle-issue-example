This project shows a missing feature in the [Keycloak Testcontainer]: 
[On-the-fly adding of extension classes to the container] doesn't work in Gradle projects. 

The logic in the [`createKeycloakExtensionDeployment`]- and [`resolveExtensionClassLocation`]-methods is assuming a directory structure as in the Maven `target`-folder. 
However, with Gradle projects, the directory structure is different. 

‚ö†Ô∏è Unit tests in this project are failing intentionally! <br>
‚ö†Ô∏è It's not going to be maintained in any way.

üëÄ See [PR 112] for further details. 

Run `./gradlew clean test` to execute the (failing) tests.
